Installation:

Note that there are executables for Windows, Mac, and Linux! You only
need to compile from source if these do not work or you want to modify
OFMC.

For compiling from source, you need Haskell/ghc (haskell.com) with the
tools Alex and Happy which are now part of all standard
installations. Also, a new modification by Jakub Janaszkiewicz uses
the parallel package to speed up search which is usually not included
in most distributions.

You can install it with "cabal install --lib parallel"

Compilation should now work with just running "make" in the src
directory.

If there are problems with the parallel library, one can always resort
to the old search by replacing "Search.hs" with "Search-classic.hs" as
a last resort.

Have fun!
